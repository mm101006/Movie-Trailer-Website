# Project: Movie Trailer Website

For this project I wrote code that uses an API from *themoviedb*. I used a get call to retreive the title, poster image, youtube trailer, as well as other information about each movie. I used two python classes to store information about each movie. When you open *fresh_tomatoes.html* file you will see a list of movies available in threater.
